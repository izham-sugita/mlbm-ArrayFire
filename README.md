# mlbm-ArrayFire
Moment-based lattice Boltzmann code on GPU using ArrayFire library.

Testing code for moment-based lattice Boltzmann method (MLBM) on GPU using ArrayFire library. This is a simple test case.

2017/09/11: Added file ArrayFireHeatEq.cu. An example of how to call CUDA kernel using ArrayFire v3.4 libary as boilerplate.
